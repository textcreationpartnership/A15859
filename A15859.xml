         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſtate of the world, to proue the perpetuitie thereof, and doe deride the word of God; <hi>Peter</hi> doth ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe their argumentation by this reaſon. The world, as by the word of God it was of the waters, and by the waters; ſo alſo by the ſame word of God, when indeede it ſeemed ſo good vnto the Lord, being drowned with the ſame waters it periſhed and came to an end; and after by the ſame word of God it was reſtored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. This Hiſtorie was moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and a thing moſt famous, and of moſt certaintie vnto the whole World. Therfore by the ſame Word of God, as in the firſt turne by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo ſecondarily by fire, when it ſhall ſo pleaſe the Lord, it may bee diſſolued, and haue an end. The Lord foretold the future end of the world, and that himſelfe would come the ſecond time: therefore this World muſt haue an end, and the Lord will come. For now are reſerued theſe Heauens and Earth vnto fire for the day of iudgement and perdition of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12063:11"/>
the vngodly: wherefore from the continuing ſtate of the world the conſequence holdeth not; That the world is vncorruptible and ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue end. For that alſo before the Flood it laſted long, and yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer (for all that) periſhed, and euen by ſuch things as from whom it had it originall, and was ſupported, (that is) by the waters; ſo by fire, an other Element of the World, the ſame world ſhall be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>The third ſort who vouch the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of the world, are ſome, who are neither abſolute Philoſophers which are deſtitute of the ſacred writings, neither yet ſcoffers and contemners of celeſtiall things, but both men fearing God, and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert of holy writ; of which kind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, was <hi>Philo Iudaeus.</hi> Hee left a boòke written with this Title<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:12063:11"/>
But if <hi>Philo</hi> had (in this ſence) vnderſtood the world to bee incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, for that neither it ſhould vtterly be diſſolued into nothing, nor yet changed into a worſe eſtate, we likewiſe would haue condiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto him. For we likewiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge out of the word of God the renouation of the world, and in the future a new Heauen and a new Earth. And ſo certainely ſeemeth <hi>Philo</hi> to haue holden by his expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, whereby he declareth what he meant by the name of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For thus he holdeth in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of his booke pag. 645. <gap reason="foreign">

Therefore we are to endeauour for a perpetuall renouation, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here in heart to God onely, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is vtterly vnchangeable: as for other thinges, they ought to be had in contempt, becauſe they all ſhal bee changed, and ſhall all finally haue an end.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:12063:13"/>
Apoſtle made mention firſt of the vanity of this world; then he added, <hi>Now are the laſt times,</hi> that is, where in is inſtant the comming of the Lord <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And why theſe things that contemning the world, and then auoyding thoſe Antichriſts, we being fortified in the Apoſtles doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, might watch and liue ſobe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

within a hundred. or two hundred or more yeares. Although (as others would haue it) the more ſincere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of that place would bee if it ſhould bee vnderſtood not ſo much of the vpriſing of the perſon of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as of his Kingdome and the progreſſe thereof, throughout the whole world vnto the end ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and of the endleſſe continuance of the ſame: for ſo it is interpreted of <hi>Daniel</hi> himſelf in the ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

For it is infallible that the end of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:12063:23"/>
the world ſhall not be, before the whole Kingdome of Antichriſt be aboliſhed, as the Apoſtle teacheth, Theſ. 2. 2.</p>
            <p>But who is able to determine of the time, when the Kingdome of Antichriſt ſhall totally come to an end? Hee that can effect the one, may likewiſe performe the other.</p>
            <p>Beſides, ſome there bee who would haue the propheſie of <hi>Daniel</hi> in no caſe to bee vnderſtood of the ſecond, but onely of the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and ſo alſo that which in the 7. chapter; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this to haue beene the counſell (or purpoſe) of God, to giue ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to <hi>Nabuchadnezar</hi> what Kingdomes ſhould ſucceed, and which ſhould be the laſt of all, that is the Kingdome of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and that to continue perpetually, all others being ruinated. But how long it ſhould endure vpon the face of the Earth, is not heere debated; neither that God intended by <hi>Daniel</hi> to giue notice vnto vs thereof, ſeeing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:12063:24"/>
it was not his pleaſure, no not by his ſonne, to reueale it. According to this interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nothing can be de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Finally ſome there be who would ſo expound the chapters of <hi>Daniel,</hi> as that in no reſpect they wil haue him ſpeake of the Romane Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy: but what all others haue inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted thereof, they will haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the Kingdome of the <hi>Selucians;</hi> ſpecially for this reaſon, becauſe the Church of the Iewes was neuermore hardly and extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreated by any other then by that Kingdome before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and moſt of all by <hi>Anti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I anſwere that this coniecture is very feeble and infirme. For firſt, the name of three years and an halfe, the Fathers doe account for naturall yeares, and they ſaid that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhould raigne ſo many naturall years before the comming of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> wherefore this is a poore collection, that they expound it of the yeares of <hi>Iubilee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, although I doe not deny the Popes Kingdome to bee the Kingdome of Antichriſt, for that therein many thinges are defended, which diametrically are repugnant to the doctrine of CHRIST; and therefore I will not gainſay, that the Pope, while hee doth defend that Kingdome which warreth with the Kingdome of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and doth obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately oppoſe him-ſelfe to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to be Antichriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

good conſequent, That no part of that time, of which the prophet here ſpeaketh can haue reference to theſe years which were praecedent the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And then from thence they gather the ſurpluſage, to be from the firſt to the ſecond co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> 2026. yeares. Certes, if thoſe 2. num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers be to be diſtinguiſhed, &amp; then after ioined together, &amp; daies be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for years; it wil be behoofeful to acknowledge, that from the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the daily ſacrifice, that is, of al Moſaical ſacrifices, &amp; the deuaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vntil the laſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of <hi>Christ,</hi> do run betweene 2625. yeers.

For there bee
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:12063:31"/>
ſome, (and thoſe men of good reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect) which hold the ſame thing to bee meant by both the numbers, (that is to ſay) That the Church of God for a long time was, and ſhould bee afflicted vnto the end of the world, but yet it was to hold out in perſeuerance manfully, and a deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to be expected: for that when no ſuch matter at all was thought vpon, as the riddance from thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, then the Church vppon the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine (as it were) in the intercourſe of time ſhould be deliuered from all theſe afflictions. Adde withall that which may be affirmed (as many ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) that this number here (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) is put downe a certaine for an vncertaine; which thing the Angell ſeemeth to inſinuate, when, ſpeaking of the ſame time, he putteth downe a different number of daies, firſt, 1290. then, 1335. For if from the time of the dayly ſacrifice aboliſhed there were but vnto the end onely 1290. daies, wherein the Church ſhould be afflicted; how doth hee
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:12063:31"/>
preſently adde withall, <hi>him to bee fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely bleſſed,</hi> who in this endurance of euils ſhall perſiſt couragious vntill the daies 1335.

            <p>I paſſe ouer this, That the Fathers and ſome others doe conſtrue this place, as that other <hi>cap.</hi> 7. of three yeares and a halfe, wherein that laſt Antichriſt was ſaid by the Ancients ſhould raigne; for thoſe daies 1290. are the ſame (in their opinion) with <hi>a time, times, and halfe a time,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they amount to three yeeres and a halfe. Finally, ſome there bee who would haue here a repetition and explanation of that, which alſo before in the end of the 9. Chapter he had ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> of that time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which the daily ſacrifice being vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly taken away, the Temple like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhould be deſtroyed by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:12063:32"/>
neuer againe to be re-edified; that is, within three yeeres and a halfe more or leſſe, for ſo long time was that warre protracted, and fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: after which preſently enſued the horrible vaſtation both of Citie and Nation. And thus they reade the words of the Angell; <hi>And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the time wherein I ſaid the dayly ſacrifice ſhould be remoued, and the obhomination of deſolation erected, are 1290 daies;</hi> ſo that this (they ſay) is the true ſenſe thereof: O <hi>Daniel,</hi> thou haſt deſired to know when the finall end of all things ſhall bee, I haue ſhewed thee that the end is ſealed and cloſed vp; neither that to thee nor any other mortall man ſhall be made any other reuelation, then as is alreadie reuealed: But concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the end of the Sacrifices, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and Gouernment of the Iewes, as alſo of the Warre to bee waged againſt them, whereof alſo I haue treated in the 9. chapter, if thou wilt learne the certaintie when this ſhall haue an end or finall determination,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:12063:32"/>
I can commonſtrate vnto you a moſt certaine ſupputation, (that is to ſay) That it ſhal be finiſhed within 1290. daies, nay, within 1335 daies. Thus hold theſe men. Therefore out of <hi>Daniel</hi> can no certaine time bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, touching the end of the World; but onely that this time is determined with God, but yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to vs; and that in this time the Church ſhould bee ſtrangely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. For, <hi>Daniel</hi> making enquiry for this end, anſwere was made, <hi>Goe thou Daniel, for the words of this Book are made up and ſealed, vntill the time of the end: Many ſhall bee purified, made white and tried, and the wicked ſhall doe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Other coniectures alſo are alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: But ſuch as I haue remembred are the principall; and we haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, that no certaine concluſion can be determined touching the end of the world. We therefore conclude, That for the time of the end of the world, either in what day, or month, or yeare, or age, it ſhall be, or that the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall come, it can neither bee comprehended by any certaine knowledge, or any firme coniectures of any mortall man: and the reaſon is; for that God will not haue it knowne, but onely to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, according to that, <hi>Of that day and houre &amp;c.</hi> This we know indeed, that the end of the world approch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth dayly nearer and nearer; but
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:12063:33"/>
when it ſhall be wee can not know. This is my determination of this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; which I clearely know; to bee both godly, and conſonant to the Scriptures, and profitable: although I make no doubt (that I may freely ſpeake my minde) but that in thoſe numbers of daies, which are prefixed by <hi>Daniel</hi> and the Apocalyps before the end of the world, are included many myſteries, touching the laſt times; which things he may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, who is endowed with a peculiar inſtinct of the holy Spirit; neither would I make doubt, but that hee might pronounce ſentence both of the end of the world, and of thoſe things which ſhall come to paſſe about thoſe times. But this gift is not granted to me: He that hath it, let him impart it. I will not deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe his prophecie: I will trie all things, &amp; in the meane time retaine that which is good.</p>
            <p>From hence conſequently ariſeth the third capitall point. Whether it be lawfull to ſearch out the certaine
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:12063:34"/>
time, that wee may know when the end of the world ſhall be. I anſwere, I am not of that opinion. For if God will not haue it to be knowne, then he doth violate the will of God, who trauelleth and ſearcheth certainely that he may know it. Beſides hee ſaith expreſſely, <hi>It is not yours to know the times and ſeaſons &amp;c.</hi> If it belong not to vs, wee may not lawfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to know. Therefore God, that hee might manifeſt to the world howmuch this curioſitie diſcomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him, hee hath effected, that ſo many as from the age of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles hitherto haue deſined any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine time of the end of the World, they haue been euicted of errour. I ſpeake of the ordinarie inquirie of all; if any extraordinarie bee called to the intelligence of theſe myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, I doe caſt no lets in the way, onely let euery one bee cautelous, that hee deceiue not himſelfe, and tempt the Lord. Surely Curioſitie is fruitleſſe, but Sobrietie moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And as they are commended
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:12063:34"/>
who loue the comming of the Lord; ſo I finde both <hi>Daniel</hi> and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to bee reiected, when they did propoſe curious queſtions; <hi>When ſhall theſe things be &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth Chapter is: why God will not haue vs know the end of the world? I anſwere, euen for the ſame reaſon why hee will not, that any ſhould know when he muſt die: Verily, that wee ſhould alwaies watch, and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Another perill is; Though wee certainely beleeue that the end of the World ſhall bee, and that the Lord ſhall come, yet leſt we ſhould deny him as yet to bee farre off, and to make delay. For this imagination is the cogitation of the euill ſeruant, and maketh a man ſecure in his ſins. Againſt this danger the Lord would haue vs alwaies to reſolue, that the day of the Lord is not farre abſent. To this effect tend theſe voices, <hi>Phil. 4. The Lord is at hand:</hi> alſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. of the euill ſeruant, who imagineth that the Lord wil not come quickly, he ſaith; <hi>the Lord of that ſeruant will come in a day when he hopeth not, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:12063:41"/>
in anhoure when he knoweth not, and will cut him off &amp;c.</hi> as though hee ſhould ſay, his Lord will ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne then that euill ſeruant expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Luc. 12. And be ye likewiſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared: for the Sonne of Man wil come at an houre when yee thinke not.</hi> For this purpoſe ſerue the ſignes fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Lord. Verily, for that whereas wee perceiue, yea from the beginning, and doe dayly ſee many of them accompliſhed already, and to come to paſſe, we ſhould therfore thinke that the Lord is not farre off, and (ſo) watch and pray. Wherfore the Lord, when he had fore-told the ſignes, he (conſequently) added the vſe of the praediction thereof, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>when yee ſhall ſee all theſe things, Kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w that he is nigh, euen in the dores.</hi> Therefore this is the ſecond vſe of theſe ſignes, That indeede by the ſight thereof wee might know the Lord not to be farre off, but quickly to returne; yet ſo, as that wee may neuer define how far off this (quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) ſhall be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:12063:42"/>The third perill is this; leſt that, becauſe the good ſeruant muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that it may ſo fall out that his Maiſter may come quickly, hee ſhould raſhly define how long or how ſhort time that (quickly) will be, and ſhould appoint any certaine time when his Lord will come. For that determination of a certain time, beſides, that it is preſumptuous, it is likewiſe repugnant to the will of God, and pernicious. Againſt this rock, the Lord will haue vs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and confeſſe, that wee cannot know this time, and that it is onely knowne to God. Againe, hee would haue vs know, that it is not our office either to ſearch out, or to know the times and ſeaſons which the Father hath put in his owne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. Hereunto alſo appertaine the ſignes, that is to ſay, That when we ſhall ſee many of them to bee origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally accompliſhed from the time of the Apoſtles, neither yet preſently the Lord to bee come, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> yet wee preſume to define (though
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:12063:42"/>
we ſee the reſt) of any certaine time of his comming, but that we ſhould know that this onely is ſeene to the Lord: and therefore, for that wee are ignorant when he will come, we ſhould alwaies watch and pray. Wherfore the Lord ſaith, <hi>Matthew, 24. If the houſholder knew at what houre the theefe would come, he would (doubtleſſe) wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> prepared</hi> (that is, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies) <hi>for at an houre when yet thinke not will the ſonne of man come;</hi> as if he had ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If yee know that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine time wherin he would returne, yee would watch onely about that time, and addreſſe your ſelues to meete me: but for that yee are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant when I ſhall come, at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:12063:43"/>
or cock-crow, or in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and yet yee know certainly that I wil come, therefore, yee ought continually to bee prepared, and in readineſſe. Theſe therefore are the three principall vſes of the tokens foregoing the end of the world, and the comming of the Lord; firſt, that by ſeeing of them we may firmely know that the Lord wil come: next, that by the ſight thereof wee may know that hee will come quickly; thirdly, that by ſeeing of them wee doe not yet determine how long this (quickly) ſhall endure; for that many of them are come to paſſe, and yet the Lord commeth not. Beſides, no ſignes doe bend that way, that by them we may be enabled to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the certaine time of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and of the end of the world. Therefore the Lord did firſt prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticate the ſignes, <hi>Matthew.</hi> 24. and then, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t any man ſhould yet thinke, that hee could gather how much ſpace of time remained touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords comming, he added,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:12063:43"/>
               <hi>Of that day knoweth no man.</hi> We ſee therefore that this ſequele hath no coherence. The ſignes are fore-told that doe fore-runne the end of the world: therefore when they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly come to paſſe, and are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed; we may not thence obſerue how much time certainely remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vntill his comming; for that there be other vſes (as is manifeſted already) of the ſignes, then that by them wee either can or ought to conclude the certaine time of the world. But by all theſe wee may eaſily collect what a Chriſtian man may doe in this queſtion, touching the end of the world. Now then out of things allready ſpoken let vs diſcuſſe the duties of a Chriſtian man to be obſerued in this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the worlds ending.</p>
            <p>The ſixt Capitall branch is; what thinges are to bee obſerued of a Chriſtian man, in this queſtion tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the end of the world.</p>
            <p>Wee muſt firmely beleeue that this world ſhall finally come to an
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:12063:44"/>
that the Lord ſhall returne, and that the world ſhall be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: wherefore ſeeing there muſt be a renouation of the Heauen and Earth, we are to giue regard, that wee likewiſe be daily renouated, as <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>When this end ſhall come, wee are not curiouſly to inquire, both for that it cannot be knowne, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the voyce of <hi>Chriſt, Mat.</hi> 24. as alſo for that we are forbidden in that ſaying, Act. 1 <hi>It appertaineth not to you to know the times.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Although we know not when hee will come, yet in the meane while we are to deſire his comming, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that <hi>Mat. 6. Let thy Kingdome come.</hi> And this is likewiſe acceptable to God, as the Apoſtle teſtifieth 2. <hi>Tim. 4. henceforth is laid vp for me a crowne of righteouſnes, which the Lord (that iuſt iudge) ſhall render vnto me at that day, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to me, but alſo to all ſuch as ſhal wiſh for his comming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Albeit wee know not when; yet
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:12063:44"/>
ought euery one continually to haue in remembrance, that the Lord may ſooner come then the world ſuppoſeth. For this is the difference betweene the good and euill ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, <hi>Luc.</hi> 12. The euil one ſaith, <hi>My Lord wil deferre his comming</hi> &amp;c. but the good one ſaith, <hi>I know not verily when my Lord wil come but I do daily expect him:</hi> for he wil come (as hee propheſied) as a thiefe in the night, that is, vpon the ſodaine. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine albeit (that I may in the <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim</hi> yeeld this) that he will not come ſpeedily to iudge the whole world, yet it may bee he wil come to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to exact of mee a priuate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my life.</p>
            <p>Becauſe we know not when the Lord wil come, we are to watch and pray perpetually, and our lamps are ſo to bee kept furniſhed with faith and good workes, as if he were to come to morrow, according to that of <hi>Chriſt, Mat. 24. Watch therefore and pray, for you know not what houre your Lord will com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If we be tempted to impatience for that the day of the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not quickly, or becauſe the Lord doth ſo long deferre his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, let vs follow the counſaile of the Apoſtle Pet. 2. Epiſt. 3. Let vs faſten our eyes, not vpon the paſſage of this temporary life, but vpon ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity it ſelfe, where all time, be it neuer ſoe long, doth vaniſh to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: and let vs bee adviſed, that a thouſand yeares with the Lord a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:12063:45"/>
of others, why the Lord doth ſo long deferre his comming? let vs anſwere as <hi>Peter</hi> inſtructeth, that he doth therefore deferre, for that hee looketh that all ſhould repent, and that he is not delighted with the perdition of men.</p>
            <p>If Queſtion be propounded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Lord will ſooner or later come? let vs follow the doctrine of CHRIST, and returne our anſwere, We cannot tell: for this is the ſafer tract.

               </gap>arnall, or deſpaite to godly men, who deſire the comming of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> if thou ſay he will come quickly, this indeed is the part of the good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, to thinke that the Lord will come quickly, and daily to expect him. And this cogitation will quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thee to ſtudy for compoſing thy ſelfe, and for to meet the Lord: but it is a raſh affirmation of that thou

bloſſome of Chriſtian liuing; yet neuer doe they bring full and ripe fruits: but in ſome preſently, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome ſhortly after, all this moiſture of faith is dried vp, either exhauſted by the great heat of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Croſſe for <hi>Christs</hi> ſake, or elſe ſuffocate with the thornes of this world. And therefore both of them is euen temporarie, becauſe both finally, as I ſaid, vtterly wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth away, and altogether cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. In this preſent queſtion of the perſeuerance of Saints in faith, doe I ſpeake of neither of theſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I euer, but onely of true faith.</p>
               <p>Now true and vnfained faith is indeede onely one, although for the power of miracles annexed in ſome, and in ſome otherwiſe, it is by ſome ſet downe as twofold; one common to all the Elect, which alſo by <hi>Paul</hi> is called the faith of the Elect; and that is it whereby the Elect are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, and liue: whereof the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, <hi>The luſt man ſhall liue by</hi>

For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vpon certaine cauſes are dignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Lord, for a limited time with this efficacy of faith in doing miracles, and fort-telling things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to come but at certaine times with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all they are deſpoyled of it, and yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

then not deſtitute of the vertue of faith, whereby they are iuſt and liue. For this faith, as it doth iuſtifie, hath euen all the ſame properties, which iuſtifying faith hath (which is) common to all the Elect.</p>
               <p>Therefore, that we may ſpeake<note place="margin">5 True faith habituall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For, as I ſhall forthwith manifeſt. Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is a vertue or certaine force, and therefore a quallity infuſed by the holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>Sometime faith is taken for the very act of faith, whereby ſeriouſly thinking and repoſing our ſelues we beleeue in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although I cannot in ſillables

demonſtrate all theſe thinges in the Scriptures, yet the very ſame diſtinction, although in other words, the Scriptures do manifeſtly teach. And firſt that faith very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is taken for the act of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing, no man doth make doubt: for this holy writ teacheth when it ſaith, <hi>A man is iuſtified by faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth remiſſion of ſinnes: vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the worlds were made;</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as are of yeares, cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, remiſſion of ſinnes without actuall faith.

               <p>
                  <hi>Bucer</hi> doth apparantly accknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this in many places, as in <hi>Ep.</hi> and Epheſ.

               <p>This true faith is diſtinguiſhed into ſtrong, which is called <hi>great;</hi> and weake which is called <hi>little fatih</hi> in the Scriptures: for in ſome it is ſtrong and great, in other ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme and litle; nay in the ſame man<note place="margin">6 Faith ſtrong and weake great and ſmall.</note> ſometime weake and very feeble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome time more firme and ſtrong.

                  </gap>aith, that vnleſſe this be preſent, it can in no caſe be called true and iuſtifying faith. Of this firſt property there is no contention amongeſt.</p>
               <p>The other eſſentiall property of true faith is, That it bee pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oetuall, and that it neuer vtterly faile in the Elect. This property I am able to demonſtrate by many teſtimonies of Scriptures, and Fathers, and our owne Doctors: but thoſe which I
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:12063:54"/>
ſhall conſquently annex, let them ſuffice for my preſent confeſſion.</p>
               <p>The faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> was not onely a liuing faith, but alſo perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, as <hi>Iames</hi> (beſides others) doth manifeſt. For although it was toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with many tentations, yet did it not at any time totally quaile. This qualitie of the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> doth demonſtrate both <hi>Moſes</hi> in the ſtory of him, as alſo the Apoſtle, <hi>Romans,</hi> 4. Now whoſoeuer are iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, are iuſtified by no other faith then that whereby euen <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of all faithfull was iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as the Scriptures euery where doe teach. Herevpon hee is called the Father of the faithfull; becauſe whoſeuer are the ſonne of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and doe beleeue that faith may be imputed vnto them for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, they both doe beleiue in the ſame Sauiour <hi>Chriſt</hi> and God as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, and by the very ſame, that is, like faith as he did, and it is requiſite that they ſhould ſo beleiue. There-vpon the Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> denied

the Iewes to be the ſonnes of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who boaſted themſelues to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſonnes: and for what cauſe? becauſe <hi>they did not the works of Abraham,</hi> that is, for that they neither beleiued in him, nor with the ſame faith that hee did. <hi>Iames</hi> alſo doth conuince ſuch as haue a dead fayth, without workes, not to be iuſtified as <hi>Abraham</hi> was iuſtified; and why ſo? for that they were n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> endued with the ſame, that is, like faith as <hi>Abraham; faith,</hi> I ſay <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

And that perpetuity is as an eſſentiall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to iuſtifying faith, and (faith)
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:12063:55"/>
leading to life <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ternall, as life is; from hence is made manifeſt: for that as they cannot bee ſaued not hauing faith; ſo neither can they who haue not the ſame perpetuall. For temporizers are neither grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God, nor in ſtate of ſaluation; and whoſoeuer ſhall perſeuer vnto the end, he onely ſhall attaine ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore it cannot be a true, iuſtifying, and ſauing faith, except it bee both liuing and permanent. And I pray you how can it be, or be called, a liuing faith, and which bringeth eternall life, vnleſſe the ſame bee alwaies liuing, but at laſt dead or vtterly vaniſhing?</p>
               <p>In the Parable of the ſeed is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planed the nature of true and falſe faith. To faith (not true) are aſcribed two properties; one, that it is not liuely, that is, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it receiue the ſeed of the word with ioy, and doe produce an apparant flouriſh euen of an honeſt life, yet doth it bring forth no true fruit, and that for this reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:12063:56"/>
the ſeede falleth into the ground which is either rocky, and therefore therein it cannot take roote; or thorny, and therefore the ſeed caſt thereinto, and now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into the bud, is ſuffocated before it can bring forth any fruit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> at all. Another property which is there aſcribed to faith (not true nor iuſtifying) is this; That it is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall, but temporary: Therefore the qualities of true faith muſt needs be contrary, that is, that it be liuing and perpetuall. And theſe like-wiſe are in the ſame place explaned, viz. in that part of the ground which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the ſeed ſowne; and therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on brought forth much fruit perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity therein is intimated, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For althogh true faith be not in all the Elect of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual ſtrength and life; yet is it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſarie that in all the Elect it be liuing and perpetuall, elſe it cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led true and iuſtifying faith. And (in good ſooth) I do not ſee, how it can be no conſequent; if faith (not true) be temporarie, then true faith is not temporarie; And if it be not tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie, then is it perpetual; for ſo much as that which is perpetuall, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to temporarie.</p>

For although he alone paid the price, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect properly is the ſole Mediator, yet hee alone doth not ſaue, that is iuſtifie, regenerate, bleſſe, but ioint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Father and the Holy Spirit; perpetuall, becauſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth the worke of our ſaluation already begunne.</p>
                  <p>So that Faith effecteth, that wee doe acknowledge by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> euen the Father to be our Father, and the Holy Spirit, as him by whom, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling within vs, we are regenerate and ſanctified.</p>

                  </hi> is as <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with his word and law: to caſt <hi>Ionas</hi> out of the ſhip into the ſea is (as it were) to caſt off, by ſinne, <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his law from vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Mariners certainly did caſt <hi>Ionas</hi> into the ſea; ſo the Saints ſinne, not by caſting the law of God from them, that is by tranſgreſſing of it, but being willing. But as they by many ſignes manifeſted, that they caſt <hi>Ionas</hi> into the ſea not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, that is, not from their deſire, and purpoſely; ſo doe the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that they will not that ſinne which yet they commit: firſt, before the tempeſt of temptations they had no mind to tranſgreſſe Gods law, but rather they hated ſinne, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the law of God; againe, being
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:12063:106"/>
aſſalted by temptations, they doe not forthwith yeeld the hand, they doe (as it were) with contrary oares, ſo much as ſtrength will affoord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and withſtand; yea by calling vpon the name of the Lord; and ſo long they doe reſiſt, vntill being (as it were) quaſhed in peeces, they doe bow downe vnder the temptation, which if it were not ſuch and ſo great, that they Saints were not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten able to reſiſt they wold neuer do that they would not, but would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies doe that they would. Thirdly, after the ſinne committed, or after the violence of the ſea, that is of concupiſcence, be abated, they doe lament the fact, and mourne, and pray forgiueneſſe, and offer the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of repentance, that hee may pardon it: verily by all thoſe things which befall to the Saints both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in, and after the temptation, and ſinne committed, it abundantly appeareth, how the Saints in ſinning both will and nill ſinne, and doe the euil they would not, and doe not the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:12063:107"/>
good they would. And therefore it cannot be ſaid of them; that they do ſin as the wicked do, with a fui will.</p>
               <p>That which I haue illuſtrated by the compariſon of the Mariners, is declared by the example of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iudas.</hi> Before the ſinne it was not in <hi>Peters</hi> heart to deny <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but rather on the contrary hee ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and deteſted both the offences and enemies of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as that indeed hee was rather ready to die, then to deny <hi>Christ;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſaid, <hi>though all ſhall deuie thee, yet I will neuer denie thee.</hi> Such alſo is the purpoſe of the Godly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſin; <hi>ſcilicet,</hi> when as they are not their owne men, and are not violently carried with violent temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as it were, out of themſelues, croſſely into abſurdities. But the mind of <hi>Iudas</hi> was not ſuch as of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but rather of a long time with a quiet mind hee had practiſed offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly theft, by defrauding <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles of their mony, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12 doth teſtifie, <hi>that he was a theefe,</hi> and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:12063:107"/>
therefore of long, and with a ſetled mind he had deliberated with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, how he might with gaine, and without tumult, betray <hi>Chriſt</hi> into his enemies hands. Such like are the minds of the wicked: they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies meditate euill, according to the prouerbe, <hi>euen in their cold bloud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the heat of temptation, <hi>Peter,</hi> though through the exceſſiue force of the feare of death, which he did perceiue as imminent vpon him, for the free confeſſion of <hi>Christ,</hi> is not recorded to haue reſiſted or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with the temptation, yet out of the quality of theſe three de nialls of his it may eaſily be collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That at the beginning hee did ſome-what in minde with-ſtand; for that hee did not directly in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance denie, but diſſemble by his cold anſwering (the Damſell, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>And thou alſo waſt with</hi> Ieſus <hi>of Galile<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.) I know not what thou ſaieſt.</hi> For after that the tempeſt encreaſed, the next turne hee denied with an oath, directly renouncing <hi>Chriſt</hi> and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:12063:108"/>
ſaying, <hi>I know not the man.</hi> But at the third turne, when the blaſt of temptation was moſt vehement, hee did not onely diſſemble, neither on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny with an oath, but alſo euen deuoting himſelfe to execrations, he accurſed, and (as <hi>Marke</hi> ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematized himſelf. But <hi>Iudas</hi> from that time of his firſt temptation touching the betraying of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was alwaies of the ſame minde: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did ſodainely fall into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>Peter,</hi> but with long delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration he did ſeeke opportunities of betraying him into their hands. So<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doe all wicked men; they doe not fall into temptation vpon the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, but they hunt and ſeeke for them. But the Godly are quite contrary.</p>
               <p>And after the offence committed <hi>Peter</hi> preſently was ſo penitent for his fact, that hee wept bitterly for his ſinne. So do alſo the Godly. But <hi>Iudas</hi> although hee came to the Prieſts, and reſtoring the mony, ſaid; <hi>I haue ſinned in betraying innocent
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:12063:108"/>
blood;</hi> yet do we not read that hee lamented, and truely ſorrowed for his offence committed. Wherefore in that he hanged himſelfe, hee did not ſo from ſorrow for ſinne, but for that he ſaw that his life ſhould bee with perpetuall infamie, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying his maiſter, ſpecially for ſo ſmall a ſumme of money. So the wicked do ſometime greeue, for their ſinne, but not properly for the ſinne it ſelfe, but either for ſhame, or for puniſhment temporall or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, whereinto they ſee they are fallen: wherefore the wicked do not declare by ſuch repentances that they hate the euil which they haue committed, but onely the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment whervnto they are liable: but contrariwiſe the Saints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed deteſt the ſinnes committed, and hate them. Who in theſe two Apoſtles, cannot ſee what difference there is betweene the ſinnes of the wicked and the godly; between the willes of one and other in their ſinnes?</p>

ſinne in yeelding to the luſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is ſo voluntarie, as that if it were not voluntarie it ſhould not bee ſinne, as <hi>Augustine</hi> in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces obſerueth. For no man could o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey Original ſinne in perfecting the concupiſcences thereof, but that he is willing. Therefore it is alwaies voluntarie.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, men obey that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and inhabiting ſinn, after a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that alſo a differing, maner. Some are obedient, and (that) wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, yet not with a full will, or ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie conſent, or with the whole heart, but as it were captiues to a Tyrant. And this befalleth them; who either of ignorance or infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie doe obey ſinne; Of ignorance, for that either ſimply they know not that they doe euill, and ſuch in no caſe are ſaid to ſinne againſt conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or if they know (<hi>in Theſi</hi>) in generall, they doe not conſider (<hi>in hypotheſi</hi>) in particular, or if they do conſider, they doe it very coldly: the violence of concupiſcence auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:12063:114"/>
their mindes from Gods Law; And of infirmitie, for that by the violence and force of ſinne either preſently ſmitten and quelled, they voluntarily yeeld themſelues; which after a ſhort reſiſtance to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, at laſt euicted they giue place a time. Wherefore theſe firſt (ſort) obey ſinne willingly, but not with a full will and totall conſent; for they doe not loue ſinne: theſe may be ſaid to ſinne againſt their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but not properly; for they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey ſinne wittingly and willingly: but yet neither vpon perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor intentiue cogitation of that which they doe, nor with full will, and full conſent, as a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is declared. Others obey with the whole will, full conſent, &amp; whole heart, and all their might: and theſe are ſuch as doe offend of purpoſed malice, or with ſtudie, and from the heart. They (properly) ſinne againſt the conſcience: for they know that they doe contrarie to the Law of God, and (that) with contempt:
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:12063:114"/>
and they obey ſinne with ſuch a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling minde, as that they loue it, and would, if they might with impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, be perpetually ſeruiceable ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. Therefore this is called euen that <hi>reigning</hi> ſinne: for that while we doe loue the concupiſcences of the ſinne of Nature, and doe from the heart fulfill them, we doe bring to paſſe effectiuely, that it <hi>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>igneth</hi> in our hearts,</p>
               <p>Therefore there be two ſorts of Actuall ſinnes, drawne from the two different manners of willing; one, which is ſo voluntarie as that it is alſo partly involuntarie, of which kinde of Actions <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> treateth in his Ethicks, which indeed is not committed with plenarie conſent, as is expounded before. This likewiſe I grant befalleth the Saints: for thus ſometime they ſinne, as <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Peter;</hi> therefore of this (as is ſaid before) there is no controuerſie. Neither is it controuerted, Whether by this ſinne the Saints are obliged with a new guilt, by the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:12063:115"/>
thereof, and ſo alſo haue need of new remiſsion of this new ſinne? for none of vs doe deny it.</p>
               <p>Another ſort is ſo vn vluntarie; as that in no reſpect it is involuntarie; for which cauſe it is called <hi>the ſinne</hi> (properly) <hi>against the conſcience,</hi> that is to ſay plenarie, and vtterly waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſcience; and therefore euen <hi>reigning.</hi> Therefore the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene vs is, concerning that other kinde of actuall ſinne. For our Aduerſaries doe vouch, That the Saints (as <hi>Peter</hi>) do offend with the whole will, and with all their heart, and ſo (properly) againſt the conſcience. And for that ſuch ſinne cannot in any wiſe conſiſt with faith; therefore hence they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That the Saints may looſe faith totally. But contrariwiſe I doe deny, that this kind of ſinne can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall the Elect, being ſanctified an regenerate: and ſo conſequently I deny, That the Elect ſanctified can vtterly fall from faith and wholly looſe the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:12063:115"/>And why I ſhould deny that this kinde of ſinne can befall the Saints, I am induced by theſe reaſons and teſtimonies. For how can Sin <hi>reigne,</hi> and by Sinne <hi>Satan,</hi> where Iuſtice and <hi>Chriſt</hi> reigneth? And how can Faith reigne there, and by Faith <hi>Chriſt,</hi> where Sinne and <hi>Satan</hi> reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth?

               <p>Then of ſuch as are endued with a true faith thus they ſay; yet touching faith, whereby a iuſt man liueth, the caſe is otherwiſe: for they that haue that faith, are the ſonnes of God, and them the Holy Spirit leadeth to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and rightfull thinges, as that the things contrary wittingly and in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding they doe not, much leſſe perſeuer in them, although they doe ſome-time, and ſinne of the imbecillity of the fleſh, and not of fayth; but not ſinnes waſting the conſcience, or ſuch as exclude
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:12063:118"/>
preſently from the Kingdome of God.</p>
               <p>In this place they verifie foure things, of ſuch as are true Saints, and the true ſonnes of God, of whome is this our Queſtion.</p>
               <p>One is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That they are guided by the Holy Spirit to doe thoſe things which are holy and rightfull. The next, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that they are ſo led by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit to ſuch things as are holy, as that witting and with vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they doe not the contrary. The third, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> That if the Saints doe not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch ſinnes as waſt the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, much leſſe therefore doe they perſeuer therein. The fourth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> That yet oftentimes through infirmity of the fleſh they doe admit ſomethings which are not of faith, and ſo doe ſinne. And they ſpeake of actuall ſinnes the ſelfe-ſame thing they doe ſignifie by the word of acting ſinne. Therefore although the Saints doe often ſinne euen actually, and with ſome conſent, by frailty of the fleſh, as be fell <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> who did

And this doctrine they comfirme by the Scriptures, and chiefly by this Syllogiſme taken from Saint <hi>Iohn: Hee that truely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth, that the Lord</hi> Ieſus <hi>is the</hi> Chriſt, <hi>is borne of God.</hi> 1. Ioh. 5. <hi>But he that is borne of God, ſinneth not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can ſinne.</hi> 1. Ioh. 3. Therefore he that truely beleiueth, he cannot ſin, that is, the ſinne waſting the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, much leſſe porſiſt in it. Theſe things are in that place word for word.</p>
               <p>Neither did I euer teach other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And indeed when I did inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> both in the Argument of the Epiſtles, and in explication of the ſecond Chapter, I confirmed at large the ſame doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.

ſecond Chapter, <hi>Hee that ſaith hee knoweth God, and keepeth not his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, is a lier.</hi> Wherefore, it appeareth what indignity to ſuch men as profeſſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> this voice did bring, which my aduerſaries bruited abroad faſely againſt mee, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding many, as alſo left in writing, <hi>ſcilicèt,</hi> That I ſhould teach, That the Saints, although they doe ſinne againſt conſcience, and liue wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and perſeuer in their ſinnes, yet that they do not looſe faith: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I did alwaies teach the contrarie according to the Scriptures, That ſuch as commit ſuch things, and perſeuere therein, not to be Saints, neither at any time to haue had a true faith, but to be the ſonnes of the Diuell.

Therefore he calleth them his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle written in the Tables of the heart, that he might intimate ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that they were his glory (both) liuing and perpetuall.</p>
               <p>Becauſe out of this inſcription of the Law in their hearts two thinges were conſequent; <hi>And</hi> I <hi>will be their God, and they ſhall bee my people;</hi> another, <hi>And they ſhall all know mee.</hi> Therefore as that inſcription of the Law is perpetually permanent; ſo it likewiſe ſignifieth, That God will perpetually be our God, and wee ſhall continually abide his people,

and that wee ſhall perpetually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God: for he is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by faith retaining the word of God.

               <p>Adde withall, that with theſe things is conioined the perpetuall forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, whereby it commeth to paſſe, that through day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offences the regenerate doe not deſiſt, both to know the Lord, and to be his people, and to retaine the Law firmely fixed in their hearts: for he preſently addeth as the cauſe of the former things, ſaying; <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I will bee mercifull to their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi> Therfore by this Prophecie hee doth excellently confirme the perſeuerance of the Saints.</p>

that the Law doth not remain writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in our hearts for euer; but that the fault lieth in vs that it abideth not firme, for that the Law is not fixed permanently in vs; for by the ſaine reaſon alſo the Couenant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with the Iſraelites, on Gods part was euerlaſting, but by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples default it was made fruſtrate. <hi>They</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>did make it fruſtrate.</hi> But if the ſame may be ſaid of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, what new thing then doth God promiſe by <hi>Ieremie?</hi> Therfore vnleſſe we will oppugne ſo cléare a word of God, it muſt be granted, That the Elect, with whom this new Couenant is made, after that the Law of the Lord, and faith of the Goſpell, be once by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit written in their hearts, can neuer fall from this Couenant, neither the Law and faith bee vtterly aboliſhed out of their hearts.

ſurpriſed. He trieth our faith, but yet for this purpoſe, that wee may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how much imperfection is alwaies intermixed in vs. Hence are are afflictions; and from thence theſe voices in the <hi>Pſalm. O God haſt thou forgotten mee? haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi> From hence it fell out that <hi>Peter</hi> by the Damſell was aſſalted and afflicted with the batterings of temptation, but yet he fell not for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, for that God put vnder his hand. For God doth alwaies ſppport his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that at laſt he ſhall ſwimme out, and break through, for the gifts and calling of God is without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And what ſhall wee ſay to theſe things. <hi>If GOD be on our ſide, who shalbe against vs?</hi> which words of <hi>Paul</hi> are not to be vnderſtood of ſome, but of al Gods elect. And God doth ſolace vs againſt this debility of faith by the mightie power of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whereby hee beareth rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all, and hath dominion ouer death and ſinne.

the Saints doe not ſinne againſt plenary conſcience: nay therefore the Saints not to commit theſe ſins becauſe they are endued with true faith which cannot endure theſe ſinnes to be with it; Agame, there it is laid downe that many haue and do fall from grace and faith.

               <p>We likewiſe, according to <hi>Bucers</hi> doctrine, doe teach thatt both the Elect and Reprobate when they ſinne by conſent, may be ſaid to fall from grace and faith, but not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether after the ſame manner. For the Reprobate, for that they doe ſinne againſt conſcience plenarily, they do vtterly and fully fall from grace, and doe entirely looſe that temporary faith totally which they had.</p>
               <p>But the Elect, for that they doe not ſinne with a full will, and full conſent, therefore neither fully nor vtterly they fall away from grace,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:12063:157"/>
neither vtterly looſe their faith, but partly; that is they are ſo ſaid to fal from the grace of their heauenly father, as ſonnes from the grace of their parents, when as they by their euil manners or offences do prouoke them to anger yet ſo, as that they neither ceaſe to be parents, nor they to be children. And ſo they are ſaid to looſe faith, as fire is ſaid to bee extinguiſhed, when either by wet fuel caſt vppon it, it is ſuffocated, or for want of wood the heat is remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but yet ſo, as the whole fire is not put out.

infirmitie, and not with ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed outrage that the mind is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Epicureall, or that there is an acceſſe of perſequuting the knowne Truth, or hatred of God, as was the fall of <hi>Dauid,</hi> of whome he ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely thus; very lamentable was the fall of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> did not lightly aſſalt him, yet could not hee driue him to an Epicureal contempt of God, or hatred, as he forced <hi>Saul.</hi> If he did not contemn or hate God, therefore he did retaine the feare of God, and loue, and ſo faith in him.

concerning this point, and for the prayer of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which hee ſaith was effectuall; it is manifeſt, that ſuch as are truely Saints, and true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, will perſeuere in faith and in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and therefore cannot vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly fall away from faith and from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and (that) for the promiſe of God and the prayer of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as my Poſition voucheth.</p>
               <p>There bee (in a manner) infinite teſtimonies in the writings of this learned man, for the perſeuerance of Saints, and certaintie of ſaluation. I will only adde herevnto one more.

hath ranſomed all ſinnes: and the grace of God which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath purchaſed, is greater then the ſinne which made alienation betweene God and man.

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:12063:171"/>
of them, when they ſinned, did to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally looſe faith, and vtterly fall from the grace of God; And the reaſon is: For neither, of them did ſinne of purpoſed malice; God preſeruing both of them from the ſinne of that qualitie, and continuing his feare and faith in both of them. Which from hence ſpecially appeareth: for that both of them did ſo repent, as that neither of them did againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the ſinnes of the ſame kind. But beſides the general teſtimonies produced, and arguments, we might alſo alleadge ſome few elſe of the conſtant faith of both of them, if formerly we had not produced more then were neceſſary.</p>
